> **Abstract:** This paper shows that a neoclassical aggregate production function yields an accounting effect of female labor force participation (FLFP) on economic growth. This accounting effect, or _gender bonus_, occurs due to a larger number of potential workers in the economy. The theory produces a linear dynamic model whose coefficients we estimate applying a system GMM approach to data from the International Labor Organization and the Penn World Tables. The results imply a positive and statistically significant effect of the growth of FLFP on economic growth and a positive but not statistically different from zero effect of the initial FLFP on economic growth. Importantly, we cannot reject that neither of these effects is only an accounting effect. Therefore, there is no support for secondary bonuses through education or population growth.
